I'm Robert Chandler, a software engineer, musician, and follower of Jesus based in Phoenix, Arizona.
I grew up in Atlanta and graduated from ASU in 2019 with a degree in Computer Science.

Since then, I've built all kinds of things:

- 🧪 quantum chemistry simulations across billions of molecules
- 📝 medical document imports for thousands of patients
- 🎵 tools for real-time audio collaboration

My desire is to develop thoughtful, principled software systems.
I am always learning, usually building, and occasionally deleting things I once thought were essential.

I also [play drums](https://rochadrums.com), dabble in other instruments, and write about what's on my mind.

If you want to connect,  I'd love to hear from you!
