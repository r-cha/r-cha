I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia, and I now live in Phoenix, Arizona.
I graduated from Arizona State in 2019 with a degree in Computer Science and have been working in tech since then.
I married my wife here in 2022, and we have a dog named Yonah (⛰️).

To get to know me best, read my [Statement of Faith](/blog/statement-of-faith).

My technical background is primarily python web backends, but I consider myself a quick learner with broad interests.
In my [projects](/projects) you'll find full-stack web apps, command line tools, and one-off scripts.
I'm most interested in and motivated by solving interesting problems.
In past roles and projects, these problems have been things like

- 🧪 computing quantum simulations for billions of molecules,
- 📝 importing millions of medical documents for thousands of patients, or
- 🎵 organizing collaboration for audio production.

I also [play drums](https://rochadrums.com) and dabble in other instruments.

I'd love to get to know you!
