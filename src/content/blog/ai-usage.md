All prose on this site was written by me directly with no AI assistance.
Any communication you receive from me is written by me directly with no AI assistance. 

I do see AI as a useful tool, and I use it at times to generate code or help plan software changes.
My conviction is that such a tool will never have a place in interpersonal communication.
