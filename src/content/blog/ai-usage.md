The impact and effectiveness of AI as a tool is undeniable.
Given the proliferation of AI output and its often-unnoted presentation of its output as human output, I strive to be transparent about my use of AI.

This site exists to represent me as authentically as possible, so I make the following commitments about the content found here and any interactions you have with me:

- All prose on this site was written by me directly with **no AI** assistance.
- Any communication you receive from me is written by me directly with **no AI** assistance.
- Some code may be generated in part **with AI**. Code that is generated entirely with AI will be noted as such.
- Some images or graphics may be generated **with AI**. These will be noted as such, including the prompt used in generation.

I aim to always fully disclose my use of AI, so if you ever have any doubts or questions, just ask!
