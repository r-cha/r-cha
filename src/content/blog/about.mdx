To get to know me best, read my [Statement of Faith](https://r-cha.dev/blog/statement-of-faith).

I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia, and I currently live in Phoenix, Arizona. I
graduated from ASU in 2019 with a degree in Computer Science and have been
working in tech since then. I married my wife here in 2022, and we have a
dog named Yonah (⛰️).

I also [play drums](https://rochadrums.com) and dabble in other instruments.

I'd love to get to know you! Reach out any way you can find - my LinkedIn
and GitHub are in the header, and my other socials are not hard to
unearth.
