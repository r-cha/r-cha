Where would I be without the love of God?
It would be hard to tell you about who I am without telling you about who He is.
As a follower of the Way of Jesus, I hold the truths of His character deep in my heart and mind and try my best to live them out in my life.

My story is simple, a testament to generations of faithful obedience to God.
I was raised in the church and, by the grace of God, accepted Christ at a young age.
Through years of tepid faith, the Lord stayed close, preparing me for the future with Him he had already laid out.
When I reached tentatively for adulthood at 18, I realized I couldn't imagine doing it outside of His presence.
Though I had no idea what that even meant, He granted me a community of friends (now family) with whom I could run toward a life more like His.

He was a friend and father when I was lonely, a teacher and mentor when I lacked knowledge, and a shepherd and defender when I was anxious.
He patiently waits on me when I ignore Him and delights when I speak to Him.
I've learned that He speaks back in ways I could never imagine!
At every turn of my life, I've found that He is the only evergreen choice.

As such, I believe:

## God

**The Lord** is 
[everlasting God, Creator of the ends of the Earth](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2040:28&version=ESV),
Father to the fatherless, and King of kings.
**Jesus** is His Son,
[fully divine and fully human](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:15-20&version=ESV),
who came to Earth to model perfect unity with the Father that we might all live in such relationship.
He died to serve as the ultimate, decisive sacrifice, atoning for all human sin, forever.
He was resurrected three days later, conquering death itself.
**The Holy Spirit** is the
[living and active spiritual presence](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:15-31&version=ESV)
of God through which His divine will is done upon the Earth.

These three live in perfect triunity as distinct expressions of the singular God.
Before time, and long after it, YHWH reigns over everything with ultimate sovereignty.

## Scripture

**The Holy Bible** is the divinely-inspired,
[always-applicable](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%203:16&version=ESV)
word of God and our most tangible interface to His will and character.
It is both historically accurate and deeply artistic, a creative and True work woven by the Holy Spirit over the entire history of humanity.

The Bible communicates God's character, desires, and plans for His people.
It tells the story of His ultimate redemptive plan for Humanity, reconciling our sin and pride to His love and mercy, highlighting our need for Him in all things.

## Creation

**The universe** was
[made by God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201&version=ESV)
to glorify Him.
Every atom and grain of sand, every rock and mountain, every cell and every creature, were designed carefully and lovingly by Him.
**Humans** are
[created by God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202&version=ESV),
in His image, for Him.
We were given agency that no other creature on Earth has: the freedom to determine our actions.

## Sin

The first humans
[abused this freedom](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203&version=ESV),
choosing pride, and we have all followed suit.

Soul, body, and mind are vulnerable to all manner of influence from the influences we consume, our fallen nature, and evil itself, therefore must constantly and diligently be formed toward Christ (the image in which we were created) through surrender to Him.

## Salvation

By [acknowledging the Lord's sovereignty and earnestly seeking Him in faith](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2010&version=ESV),
He fills us with the Holy Spirit that we might be transformed by Him and formed more toward His image.
It is [by grace through faith](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202&version=ESV)
that we are saved,
and [through our lifestyle](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2013:35&version=NIV)
that we demonstrate our transformation in Christ to others.

## Evangelism

By the very nature of God, He [made a way](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:6&version=ESV) for all people to approach Him in repentance and receive forgiveness and salvation, becoming a part of His people.
He is the only way to salvation, so **following Christ means abandoning pluralism.**
While there are inarguable psychological and emotional benefits to the _practice of any religion_, they pale in comparison to the freedom and joy in _relationship with the Creator_.
This is not elitism or gatekeeping, but a free gift offered too all who will receive it; for those of us who have been transformed by this gift, it can only be expected that we would seek to lead others into the same relationship with our Creator and Redeemer.
My faith would mean nothing if I didn't want others to share it.

That is why this site features a statement of faith - I've been transformed by the love of God, and it infuses all I do!
It would be dishonest to advertise myself without this aspect of my life.

If you have any questions about this at all or wish to share your own faith with me, please reach out.
