# How To Python on MacOS

## Installing Python

1) Open `Terminal.app`
2) Enter `python --version` to see if system python is installed

If it is, it will likely say "Python 2.7.8" or something like that.  
You *might* be able to use that to run whatever script you want, so skip to "Running A Script" to try it out.  
More likely, you will need Python 3, which is not installed by default.

3) Follow the instructinos at [this tutorial](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#how-to-install-python-on-macos),
because it is more robust than I care to include here.

## Running A Script

Once python exists and you have a script to execute, running a python script is pretty easy.

1) In your Terminal window, enter `python <name_of_script>`.

So if your script is called `my_script.py`, the command would read `python my_script.py`.

2) See what happens ðŸŽ‰
